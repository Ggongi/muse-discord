"""The crawl (crawl.py) as a test: every response from every /settings
entry point, and from every control those pages render, stays within
Discord's limits, never lets a name ping, mention or link, never
crashes and never calls its own control out of date. No copy is
checked: the redesign may change any word.

Usage: [MUT_DIR=<tree>] python3 tests/settingsui/test_crawl.py"""
